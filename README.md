### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for dropping by my GitHub profile! I'm UroÅ¡ JevtiÄ‡, a Masterâ€™s student and a graduate electrical and computer engineer, passionate about exploring the ever-evolving world of software development and technology. I love turning creative ideas into functional and innovative solutions.

When I'm not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me leading epic Dungeons & Dragons adventures, binge-watching sci-fi or fantasy series, or listening to some good music.
