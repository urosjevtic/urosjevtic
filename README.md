### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for dropping by my GitHub profile! I'm UroÅ¡, a student and a passionate software engineer, on a quest to dive deep into the exciting world of technology and shake things up with some innovative ideas. When I'm not coding, you can often find me embarking on epic Dungeons & Dragons quests with friends, binge-watching the latest movies and TV shows (especially sci-fi and fantasy) or jamming out to my favorite tunes.
